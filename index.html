      <p>
        your smile, your laugh, your voice, your personality, your hair, your
        eyes, the way you say my name, everything about you is just perfect, I
        just love everything about you. Wherever you are, I hope you are fine
        and surrounded by good at people and I also hope that wherever you are
        and whoever you are with, hopefully that person will never hurt you like
        i did. Sorry if I ever hurt you. I also realized that maybe we would
        never be together again.
